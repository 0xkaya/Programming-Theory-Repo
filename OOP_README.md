# Programming Theory in Action

## Overview
**This project incorporates various object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It includes interactive elements like animals, food, and objects, with realistic movement, sounds, and visual effects.

## Features

- **Data Persistence Between Scenes**: Uses `PlayerPrefs` to store and retrieve data, ensuring consistency when switching between scenes.
- **Animal, Food, and Object Classes**: Created and managed classes for animals, foods, and objects to organize game logic and interactions.
- **Pop-up Information**: Displays relevant information for each object when interacted with, enhancing user experience.
- **Markers for Animals and Foods**: Visual markers are placed for animals and foods to help players locate them easily.
- **Animal Movement**: Animals move with variable speeds based on their type, making the game dynamic and engaging.
- **Animation and Particle Effects**: Animal movements trigger animations and dust particle effects, providing a more immersive experience.
- **Click & Eating Sound**: Sound effects are triggered on user interactions, such as clicking and eating, adding to the atmosphere.

## Programming Concepts 
This project applies the following object-oriented programming (OOP) methodologies:
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complex logic within objects and exposing only essential features.
- **Inheritance**: Deriving classes (such as different animals) from base classes to share common functionality.
- **Polymorphism**: Enabling different behaviors for objects based on their class type, e.g., different animal movements.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on the data into one unit, ensuring better data management and security.
